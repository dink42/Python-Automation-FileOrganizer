# Organize files

## An easy project, easy to understand, good to test out python and get a feel for it

> [!NOTE]
> Check out Tim on youtube if you like python and projects like this. He is really good providing ideas you can do!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will have to run the python file every time you want to clean up your downloads folder.
> Maybe if it is not to much hassle I will check how to make a python exe and develop more on the project and release a package. So it can be used as an easy app to clean upp your downloads folder. Or further by request.
